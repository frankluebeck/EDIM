  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <p>
  The   main purpose   of  the  EDIM  package  is  to  publish  an
  implementation  of an  algorithm   (found by the  package author)  for
  computing  prime parts of  the elementary divisors of integer matrices
  (i.e., the diagonal entries of the Smith normal form).
  </p>

  <p>
  The programs are  developed  and already  successfully used for  large
  matrices (up to rank &gt;12000) with moderate entries and many non-trivial
  elementary divisors which are products of some  small primes. But they
  should be useful for other types of matrices as well.
  </p>

  <p>
  Among the other functions  of the package  are: An inversion algorithm
  for large  rational matrices  (using  a p-adic method),  a program for
  finding  the largest  elementary divisor     of an integral     matrix
  (particularly  interesting when   this    is much  smaller  than   the
  determinant) and  implementations   of some    normal form  algorithms
  described  by  Havas,  Majewski,  Matthews,  Sterling  (using LLL-  or
  modular techniques).
