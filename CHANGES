1.3.5 - corrected wrong link in PackageInfo.g

1.3.4 - small adjustment in kernel function to make it work with future
        GAP > 4.10.2
      - cleaned up various places in documentation, scripts, PackageInfo.g
      - added tests and test file which can be used with routine package 
        tests of GAP

1.3.3 - improved argument checking of kernel function, also made it work
        with matrices of long integers
      - added a test file for package tests for GAP distribution
      - provide (simpler) configure/Makefile.in for build system in
        GAP > 4.8 (but old versions kept, will still work with older
        versions of GAP)
      - provide a public repository at
            https://github.com/frankluebeck/EDIM

1.3.2 - setting LANG and LC_ALL environment variables to "C" in configure
        script to avoid some locale related problems under OS X

1.3.1 - adjust installation instructions to GAP >= 4.5.3.
      - avoid warning in AvailabilityTest (use DisplayPackageLoadingLog
        to see the possible warning)

1.3   This is for GAP >= 4.5  
      - now using proper Info statements (all messages sent to stderr)
      - all files and doc source are now UTF-8
      - adjusted manual examples
      - removed all pre-4.4 commands
      - doc adjusted to newer GAPDoc version
      - adjusted to build mechanism of GAP 4.5, supporting CONFIGNAME
      - improved Makefile and scripts
      - added copy of GPL

1.2.3 - catch a case or invalid input.
      - slight change of kernel module to allow several packages with kernel
        modules with a statically linked GAP.

1.2.2 - change init.g/read.g to depend on GAP 4.4.
      - added a reference.
      - documented RationalSolutionIntMat and explained use for
        rank computation or singularity proof.

1.2.1 - added a src/compstat.c file for easier install with other kernel
        changes.
      - corrected the tth and MathML versions of the manuals: the <var>
        elements in formulae and use of unicode character entities.
      - removed unnecessary files.

1.2  small adjustments for GAP 4.4, added a PackageInfo.g file

1.1  - transformed the documentation to GAPDoc format
     - some small changes in code
     - possibility for producing static `gap' with EDIM kernel function

1.0b changed Makefile to use the `gac' script for compilation

1.0  initial release
